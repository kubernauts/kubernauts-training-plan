# Fundamental Kubernetes Learning Course

---

# About Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for container based distributed applications. Originally created by Google based on principles from its internal orchestration system \(e.g Borg\), Kubernetes is now developed on GitHub, it provides several level of fault-tolerance, scalability and useful primitives that go beyond the single container concept.

# What you will learn?

This one day course serves as a crash course to learn the basics of Kubernetes through our **instructor-led training** virtual classes. You will learn Kubernetes architecture and how to deploy it locally or in the cloud. You will then learn how to use its basic primitives \(i.e pods, deployments and services\) to build your own distributed application. The course will be a mix of lectures, demos and hands-on exercises.

## The fundamental Kubernetes Learning Course

The course is organized in 5 sections:

1. Kubernetes architecture and deployment scenarios \(local, cloud, bare metal, etc..\)

2. Kubernetes primitives and API

3. Running a distributed application on Kubernetes

4. Kubernetes Install / Distro / PaaS options \(guide to find the right solution for your business case and needs\)

5. Basic Kubernetes Operation Tipps & Tricks
